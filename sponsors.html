<h3>JCPenney</h3>
<p>Our team owes a great deal of success to our sponsor JCPenney. They have been our sponsor since our rookie year. Their financial support our first year made it possible for us to participate. Their continued support allows us to grow and mature. They sponsor us beyond the annual corporate contributions. Their employees fundraise significant additional monies for us every year. They have brought our team meals and snacks during build season. Their store managers attend our competition each year, even when it is out of state. Maintaining, nurturing and growing this relationship is very important to our team. Each fall we acknowledge their sponsorship by providing lunch and dinner for all the employees on a Saturday. We repeat this meal in the spring after competition and present the store with a competition team photo to say thank-you. We include them in all our publications and media releases...we feel it is very important that the public be made aware of JCPenney's sponsorship of our team.

<h3>ORNL</h3>
<p>Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been an amazing sponsor because of all they have helped the team do.  On nights and weekends they have top engineers and scientists working with students to build a full-size game field, mentoring and building relationships with students, and facilitating strategy and problem solving discussions with other teams in the area. They have donated $2000 to each team with the promise of more if the team makes the world competition. They have also opened up their new Manufacturing Demonstration Facility to the teams where they use additive manufacturing to print parts in 3D out of plastic and titanium at no cost to the team.
