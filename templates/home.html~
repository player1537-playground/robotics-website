<p>We are Flagship Robotics, a little robotics club from Farragut, TN. We bring students together that are interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Computer Programming, Marketing, and Media to create a functioning robot to enter in the <a href="http://usfirst.org">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> (FRC). Our team is student led, with the mentors playing a crucial role without doing a majority of the work. Students take initiative in leading and learning from each other. In addition to building a robot, we also reach out to the community and help other FIRST Teams. We do this by spreading knowledge of FIRST through multimedia and by helping the community. We host a merit badge workshop for the local boy scout troops and even hosting a summer camp for younger children that have an interest in robotics.</p>
