<h1>FIRST</h1>

 <p>Challenge, Creativity, Hard Work, Dedication, and most of all, Fun. All of these things are the essence of FIRST. FIRST stands for "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology". Their mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded skills, including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
 <p>Dean Kamen envisioned an organization to inspire students in engineering and technology. This vision came true in 1989 when he founded FIRST. The cornerstone of FIRST is Gracious Professionalism. This means that you respect one another helping where you can, while also retaining the fun and intensity of the spirit of competition against one another. Additionally, "coopertition" is the basis of FIRST, because even though you are constantly competiting you still are helping, learning, and leading, while also being taught, helped, and mentored.</p>

 <h3>FIRST Robotics Competition FRC</h3>
 <img class="parimage" src="images/frc.jpg" alt="FIRST Logo" />
 <p> The FIRST and most challenging program developed through FIRST, the FIRST Robotics Competition is designed to inspire  and prepare high school students to become engineers by giving them real world experience working with engineers to develop a robot that would compete in a creative competition. The inaugural competition occured in 1992. It was played with 28 teams and a single 14 x 14 foot playing field in a New Hampshire high school gym. Today, it has more than 2,000 teams participating nationwide and internationally, in over 60 regional events and in a culminating championship event in April of each year.</p>
 <p>While the competition challenge changes each year, the same idea since the orginal competition has held fast. Teams must follow a set of rules when constructing the robot such as a weight limit and a limit on the amount of money put into the robot. They are issued a kit which contains a base set of parts. Details of the game are released on the first Saturday in January, and the teams are given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks. After the robot is complete, the team heads to competition to see if their effort will pay off with an award. However,  FIRST  redefines winning for these students because they are not only rewarded for fairing well in the challenge, but also in excellence in design, demonstrated team spirit, Gracious Profesionalism, maturity, and the ability to overcome obstacles. In comparison to this scoring the most points becomes less important. In the end a succesful season means having fun and building partnerships that last.</p>

 <h3>FIRST Lego League</h3>

 <img class="parimage" src="images/fll.jpg" alt="FIRST Logo" />
 <p>FIRST LEGO League (FLL ) is an exciting and fun global robotics program that ignites an enthusiasm for discovery, science, and technology in kids ages 9 to 16. Each year FLL  teams embark on an adventurous Challenge based on current, real-world issues. Guided by a team coach and assisted by mentors, the kids research and solve a real-world problem based on the Challenge theme, present their research and solutions, and build an autonomous robot using engineering concepts.</p>

 <h3>Junior FIRST Lego League</h3>

 <img class="parimage" src="images/jrfll.jpg" alt="FIRST Logo" />
 <p> The newest  FIRST  program, Junior FLL  introduces younger students into the exciting world of science, technology, and engineering. Just like FLL , this program features a real-world challenge, to be solved through research, critical thinking and imagination. Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students work with LEGO  elements and moving parts to create solutions to the challenge. The teams participate in exhibitions around the country, where they demonstrate and explain their models and research for award opportunities.</p>

 <h3>FIRST Tech Challenge FTC</h3>
 <img class="parimage" src="images/ftc.jpg" alt="FIRST Logo" />
 <p>The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is also a robotics competition for high-school students, robotics competition for high-school students that launched in 2005. It offers the same fun, traditional challenge of a  FIRST  Robotics Competition but with a more accessible and affordable robotics kit. The ultimate goal of FTC  is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of science, technology, and engineering. It can often be a bridge in between the enjoyable stage of the FLL and the challenging FRC.</p>
