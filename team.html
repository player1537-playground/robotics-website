<h1>About the Team</h1>
<p>We are Flagship Robotics, a little robotics club from Farragut, TN. We bring together students that are interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Computer Programming, Marketing, and Media to create a functioning robot to enter in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). In addition to this, we also reach out to the community and help other FIRST Teams.</p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<img class="parimage" src="images/teampic.jpg" />
<p>The team began in 2009 with three teachers and a handful of students at our school. The future looked uncertain yet exciting, but in the end we pulled it together and went to the Peach Tree Competition in Georgia. With JCPenney as a sponsor and supporter, we were motivated throughout the season. We had no idea what to expect at competition, and were awed by the competition as well as by other teams' robots. When all was said and done, we were successful. Although we had come home empty-handed, we managed to survive our first season and set up a bright future for our future team.</p>
<p>Every year since then, we have been improving our skills and have been attracting more attention from students and sponsors. We even managed to maintain a close relationship with JCPenney while putting an emphasis on outreaching to the community.</p>
<h3>Mentors</h3>
<p>While the team is student led, none of this could be possible without the help of mentors. Many professional engineers come to the shop daily to help guide us in our efforts and pursuit of knowledge. They guide us in making creative solutions and possible ideas we can use. Our mentors have been in their field of work for years and have huge amounts of experience, which is invaluable to the team.</p>
<h3>Program Benefits</h3>
<p>Students in our program receive many benefits like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learning new skills in technology and business</li>
	<li>Mentorship under experienced mentors</li>
	<li>Insight into the inner-workings of the technical world</li>
	<li>Countless <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/scholarshipsearch.aspx">scholarships</a></li>
	<li>And of course, loads of fun and challenge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Team Activities</h3>
<p>In addition to building the robot, our students participate in a variety of activities. Our students learn new skills on the job, senior members guide and teach newer members while they work on the robot. In this way, the robot is built more efficiently and we have a team ready for the next season. We also give back to the community and help promote FIRST Robotics. Students use multimedia to communicate not only with each other, but also with anyone interested in robotics.</p>
<h3>Robotics Camp</h3>
<p>Annually we hold a day camp for high school and middle school students in our area. They learn how to design, build, and program a simple robot. We guaruntee it will be one of the most fun and informative experiences you will ever have.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about this, here is the information sheet on the <a href="2012  Robotics Camp Info and Forms.pdf">Robotics Camp</a></p>

<h3>Merit Badge Workshop</h3>
<p>A couple times a year, we hold a merit badge workshop for local Boy Scouts. It covers the content of the Robotics Merit Badge. Mentors from local troops will be there to guide the boys.</p>
